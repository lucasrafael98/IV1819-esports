note the adblock thing on the report just to be safe
replace barchart with a "no data avail" message if there isnt any data for the month/country
show what is selected in the scrollbar (lines from the barchart edges to scroll selection)
show info while hovering on countries
disable being able to select countries w/ 0 or 1 players
remove countries w/1 player from the scatter plot
make font sizes more consistent (esp the top bar "show players/earnings fonts")
[EBA = earnings by age]
make the country whose EBA is currently shown on the bar chart a different color
maybe make the bar chart display several country EBA at a time
